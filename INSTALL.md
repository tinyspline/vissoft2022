Pre-built binaries of TinySpline's Python binding (for Linux, Windows,
and macOS) can be installed via `pip`:

```sh
python -m pip install tinyspline
```

Please note that on macOS you probably need to change the path to
Python in `_tinysplinepython.so` via `install_name_tool`.

For more details (and if you would like to compile TinySpline on you
own) please see the installation instructions in our GitHub
repository: https://github.com/msteinbeck/tinyspline
