The video [showcase.mp4](showcase.mp4) shows edge animation in action
(use case evolution). The spontaneously appearing and disappearing
splines are edges that are not present in the previous/next version of
the Code City. We haven't found a good metaphor for this kind of edges
yet. The shaking nodes are source-code files that changed from one
version to another (e.g., the mapped metrics, the location within the
Code City, and so on).

The Python script [evaluation.py](evaluation.py) was used in our
evaluation. More details can be found in the documentation of this
file.

The Python script [demo.py](demo.py) provides a small demo
application based on Tkinter.

See [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) for installation instructions.
