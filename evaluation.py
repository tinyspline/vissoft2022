# This Python script was used in our paper "Edge Animation in Software
# Visualization" (Section V "Evaluation") and measures the time needed
# by TinySpline (https://github.com/msteinbeck/tinyspline) to compute
# the different operations of B-Spline morphing (spline alignment and
# the application of a morphism).
#
# In TinySpline, B-Spline morphisms are represented by the "Morphism"
# class. An instance of this class (i.e., a morphism from one spline
# to another) can be set up as follows:
#
#   origin = BSpline(...)
#   target = BSpline(...)
#   morphism = origin.morph_to(target)
#
# Once a morphism is set up, it can be evaluated at interpolation
# parameter `t' (0 <= t <= 1) with:
#
#   spline = morphism.eval(t)
#
# or with the overloaded operator `()':
#
#   spline = morphism(t)
#
# More details on the general usage of TinySpline can be found in our
# paper: "TinySpline: A Small, yet Powerful Library for Interpolating,
# Transforming, and Querying NURBS, B-Splines, and BÃ©zier Curves".
